# My-Learning-Analytics-Journey

Welcome to my education data mining and learning analytics page! Here, you will find several of my completed projects which help school teachers with personalized instructions, and school administrators with course planning. I also worked on two different datasets (Twitter.csv and Scores.csv) to help develop an automated intervention which helps teachers increase students' leanring engagement and performances.
